Source:
The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the
feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.

Workflow:

▪️Importing the libraries.
▪️Data collection and analysis.
▪️Separating the data according to their features and target.
▪️Splitting the data to the Training data and Test data.
▪️Data Standardization.
▪️Model Training using SVM model.
▪️Model Evaluation (Calculating the accuracy score).
▪️Building a predictive system.

Outcomes:
▪️By Executing the code we will get the result as :
▪️The accuracy of Training data is 88.46%
▪️The accuracy of Test data is 87.17%
▪️Results from predictive system.

▪️Here the status is predicted as 0 .
Status 0 indicates that the data belongs to non - Parkinsons patients.
