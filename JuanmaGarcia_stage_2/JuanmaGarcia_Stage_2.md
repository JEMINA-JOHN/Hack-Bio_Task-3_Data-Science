## What is Parkinson’s Disease?
Parkinson's disease (PD), or simply Parkinson's, is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. The symptoms usually emerge slowly, and as the disease worsens, non-motor symptoms become more common. The most obvious early symptoms are tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and difficulty with walking.

## What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.

## Objective
* Detecting Parkinson’s Disease with XGBoost.
* To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

### Dataset Information
We use the UCI ML Parkinsons dataset for this. The dataset has 24 columns and 195 records and is only 39.7 KB.
